# AirBnB Clone Project

## 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console

## Description
Welcome to the AirBnB clone project! This project is the first step towards building a full web application that mimics the functionality of AirBnB. The primary goal of this initial phase is to create a command interpreter to manage AirBnB objects using Python.

## Command Interpreter
The command interpreter allows you to perform various operations on AirBnB objects, such as creating new objects, retrieving objects from storage, performing operations on objects, updating object attributes, and destroying objects. It serves as a crucial component for the subsequent development stages of the web application.

### How to Start the Command Interpreter
To start the command interpreter, run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
$ ./console.py
